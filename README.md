# KNN2
This is demonstration of K Nearest Neighbor Algorithm on a public dataset.
The unlabeled dataset contains 5 numeric features and no class labels.
a. Implement K-Means Clustering for this clustering problem. Find the optimal ‘K’ for
the problem.
b. Apply your K-Means clustering algorithm to the dataset with K=4 and see how
well the clusters align with the additional first attribute in the test set
(holiday.test). This test set is the exact same data with an additional first columnvalue for each data item.
